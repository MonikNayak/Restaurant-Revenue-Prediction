# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction
Machine Learing Using Advance Python
This is my Data Science Project which i completed during my minor project. This project consists of: -> Python for transformation or cleaning of data -> Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for visualization of data -> Machine Learning for calculating the accuracy of the data

Basically i used: -> My data was related to predicted the revenue for restaurants so it was a classification supervised problem. -> So the alogrithms that i used: -XGBoost Classifier -Linear Regression -Random Forest Classifier.
